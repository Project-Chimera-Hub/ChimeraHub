/* ============================================================
   WHAT THE RECORD SHOWS
   ============================================================

   Pure functions over a folded archive: a calendar, streaks, a series to plot,
   a per-mode breakdown, and a CSV. Nothing here touches the DOM or storage, so
   every claim the page makes is a function that can be checked.

   **The three states are the reason this module exists.**

   Every other tracker's heatmap has two: trained, or didn't. That works when
   the tracker *is* the trainer and therefore always knows. This one ingests
   exports from apps it does not own, so it has a third state and cannot avoid
   it — a day can be inside a span some export vouched for (so an empty day
   really was a rest day), or outside every span (so nobody knows, and the usual
   cause is that site data was cleared before an export was taken).

   Drawing those two the same colour would assert you rested through exactly the
   stretches where the record was lost, which is the one lie this project exists
   to avoid.
