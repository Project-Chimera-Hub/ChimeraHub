/**
 * Mapping Conflict — the analogy that breaks the pairing.
 *
 * Read off the card, an analogy here is two pairings and nothing else, so the
 * whole item can be recomputed without a relation being interpreted: parse each
 * line into its four names, take the pairings they imply, and see which single
 * withdrawal repairs the set.
 *
 * Three claims are checked that way, and the third is the one that matters. A
 * disagreement between exactly two analogies is repaired by dropping either of
 * them, and an item like that marks one of two right answers wrong while the
 * card says "exactly one". That is the common accident, not the rare one — which
 * is why the generator walks every withdrawal, and why this walks it again.
