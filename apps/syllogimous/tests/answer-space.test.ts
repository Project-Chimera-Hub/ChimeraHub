/**
 * How much of the card the answers may take.
 *
 * The card is a flex column — header, body, footer — and the footer sizes to
 * whatever the mode answers with while the body takes what is left. That was
 * right when a footer held True and False. A selection offers one row per
 * relation, and `Interval Algebra` offers thirteen: measured in a real browser
 * on the built app at 420 x 880, the footer came to **619px, seventy per cent
 * of the card**, leaving the premises 259px in which to show 417px of
 * statements.
 *
 * The item still worked in the sense that every control was reachable. It had
 * simply stopped being answerable: the reader was choosing between eight
 * relations with most of the statements they are about scrolled out of sight,
 * and on a wider window the setup line was cut off mid-sentence. The options
 * had won the argument with the question.
 *
 * ── Why this is a test about CSS text ──
 *
 * The suite runs under node and cannot measure a layout, so this checks the two
 * rules that make the guarantee rather than the guarantee itself. That is worth
 * having anyway: the fix is one declaration, it is invisible in every mode whose
 * footer already fits, and nothing else in the suite would notice it going.
 *
 * The numbers came from the browser. This is what keeps them true.
