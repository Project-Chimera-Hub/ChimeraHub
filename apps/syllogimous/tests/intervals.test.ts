/**
 * Interval Algebra — every relation still possible between two periods.
 *
 * The answer is a set of thirteen bits, and the expensive half to get right is
 * the zeroes. Marking a relation the premises rule out is loud — the player
 * works out that it cannot happen and is told they were wrong. *Failing* to mark
 * one that survives is quiet: the card reads sensibly, the explanation reads
 * sensibly, and a player who found the extra possibility is failed for finding
 * it. So both halves are recomputed here from the card as shown, by enumerating
 * the arrangements of endpoints the way a player would have to.
 *
 * The relations are read out of the markup rather than out of the prose: the
 * card marks each one with an own-rule span, and the rule's key *is* the
 * relation's index. That makes the parse exact, and it checks the keys are the
 * ones the phrasing table knows — a mode using `allen-13` would render nothing
 * and this would say so.
