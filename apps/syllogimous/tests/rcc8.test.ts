/**
 * Region Connection — the eight relations, and the exact set.
 *
 * The domain is rectangular patches, which is a *restriction* of RCC8, so the first
 * thing worth checking is that the restriction still carries the eight relations
 * and that they mean what they are called. That is done twice over: once against a
 * second derivation of the relation from the four corners of two rectangles, and
 * once against the composition RCC8 itself gives for a known pair — if those agree,
 * the mapping from two interval relations to a region relation is the right one.
 *
 * Then the card: the marked set has to be exactly the relations some allowed
 * arrangement realises, both halves. Marking one too many is loud; marking one too
 * few fails the reader who found it, and nothing about the item looks wrong.
