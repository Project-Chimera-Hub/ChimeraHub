/**
 * Missing Premise — which further fact would settle it.
 *
 * Isomorph's guide: *"Premises name only some directions, so a pair can be
 * settled on one axis and open on another. Of four further true statements,
 * exactly one would settle the named pair in every direction: find it. The
 * others help somewhere, just not where it is needed."*
 *
 * The third question this family asks about the same material. Possibility Sets
 * asks what the premises leave open; Minimal Premises asks which of them did
 * the settling; this asks what is *absent* — what one more fact would have to
 * say for an open pair to close. Being able to name the gap is what tells
 * reading an argument apart from following one.
 *
 * ── Two candidates, not four ──
 *
 * Isomorph offers four. This offers two, because the reason for the house rule
 * lands squarely on four here rather than glancing off it: a menu of four
 * statements about four different pairs is exactly the case where three go
 * without being reasoned about, dismissed for not naming the entities in the
 * question. Two candidates that both name relevant entities have nothing to be
 * dismissed for, so the item is answered by working out what each would close
 * rather than by reading which is on topic. The floor is one in two instead of
 * one in four, which makes the item harder rather than easier.
 *
 * ── What makes an item well-formed ──
 *
 * The pair asked about is open on the premises alone, or there is no gap. Both
 * candidates are true of the arrangement the premises came from, so neither can
 * be rejected for being false — the question is what they *settle*, not whether
 * they hold. Adding the answer closes the pair; adding the other does not.
 *
 * And the other one is not inert: it closes some pair the premises had left
 * open, just not this one. Without that check a distractor could be a fact that
 * bears on nothing at all, and the item would be solved by finding the
 * statement that does anything rather than the statement that does this.
