/**
 * The Isomorphism family — same structure, different names.
 *
 * Four modes in one file, on the precedent `ndspace.ts` sets for the composed
 * spaces: they are the same question asked four ways over one substrate, and the
 * wording of an arrow has to be identical across them or two cards that mean the
 * same thing read differently. What varies is which sub-structure is asked about.
 *
 * ── What they share, and why it is the hard part ──
 *
 * Every entity here is named, and the names carry nothing. Position carries
 * nothing either — there is no space, only arrows. So the only thing a reader can
 * work with is the pattern of connections, and the only way to compare two
 * patterns is to try to line them up. That is why these are late modes: nothing
 * about them can be read off one premise, and nothing accumulates along a chain
 * the way a relation does.
 *
 * The systems on a card are given *separate vocabularies* rather than headings.
 * A heading is a line that is not a premise, and the reader has to be told which
 * block it governs; distinct names make the grouping a property of the sentences
 * themselves, which is also how Isomorph does it.
 *
 * ── Two candidates where Isomorph offers three or four ──
 *
 * Structure Match and Motif Search are choices, and this app holds a choice to
 * two options unless the options are the card's own premises. Three candidate
 * systems would be a menu of three claims about three different groups — the
 * case the rule was written about. Two makes the floor a half rather than a
 * third, which makes the item harder, and the decoy is built to be one arrow away
 * so it cannot be dismissed by counting.
