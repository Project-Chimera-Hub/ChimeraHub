/**
 * Concave Regions — Region Connection when the regions have a hollow in them.
 *
 * RCC8 asks how two regions stand, and over convex regions that is the whole story.
 * Cut a bay into one and it stops being the whole story in one specific place: a
 * patch nestling *inside* another's bay, touching nothing, and a patch lying
 * somewhere else entirely are both `apart from`. RCC8 has one word for two
 * situations that could not be less alike, and Cohn's RCC23 and its refinements
 * exist to name the difference. `concave-regions.utils` builds the naming; this is
 * the mode that asks about it.
 *
 * ── Why this is not Region Connection with more words ──
 *
 * Region Connection gets its exact answer set by *enumerating* every qualitative
 * arrangement of three rectangles — 167,281 of them — and that is what lets it say
 * "these five and no others". The same enumeration over three patches would run
 * over the interleavings of twelve x-coordinates against twelve y's, which is not a
 * number anything finishes. So the answer here cannot be enumerated, and a
 * *sampled* answer would be worse than none: a sample can only ever be too small,
 * so the card would omit a relation that is genuinely possible and mark a reader
 * wrong for finding it.
 *
 * What makes the mode work is that the two directions are not symmetrical.
 * **Possible** is settled by one actual triple of patches, so sampling is sound in
 * that direction by construction. **Impossible** is settled by a rule about regions
 * — "A is within B, and B shares no point with C, so neither does A" — which holds
 * over every region there is. Nothing else is offered. So the menu is exactly the
 * relations something can be *proved* about, and the reader's task ("rule out what
 * the premises forbid, select what is left") and the marked answer are the same set
 * with no gap between them.
 *
 * ── Why the menu is short when the calculus is not ──
 *
 * Thirty-two relations is far past what a card can show, which is the problem this
 * mode had to solve before it could exist. Showing a sample of them would make most
 * items easy for the wrong reason: an option about containment, when the premises
 * are about contact, gets dismissed without being thought about.
 *
 * So the options are the *closest* relations to one of the answers, by the paper's
 * own measure — the number of cells two intersection matrices differ in. Every
 * option is then a relation that very nearly holds, most of them differing from the
 * answer in one clause, and none can be dropped at a glance. The limit on what the
 * card shows is the same thing as the limit on what makes the item hard, which is
 * the only kind of shortening worth having.
 *
 * ── What grows ──
 *
 * How near the four options are to an answer, and nothing else (see
 * `neighbourhood`; the menu itself is capped at four). There are always two premises: the chain is three
 * patches and the third pair is the question. A fourth patch would need the
 * composition of a composition, and the intermediate relation is not determined —
 * so that would need the exact set this mode has just finished explaining it cannot
 * have. What each extra option costs is real, though: another relation to find an
 * argument about, and `guessRateFor` prices a selection at one subset in `2^n`.
