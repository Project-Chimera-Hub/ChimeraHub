/**
 * Context Shifts — a relation treated as an object and then operated on.
 *
 * Isomorph's guide: *"A context is a relation treated as an object: 'context A is
 * how X stands to Y' names a displacement, and later contexts transform it —
 * reversed, mirrored along one axis, turned a quarter, or counted only along the
 * directions another context moves in. Work each context out in order, then state
 * where the final point lands. Turns and mirrors do not commute: the order they
 * are applied in matters."*
 *
 * Second-Order compares two relations and asks what was done to one to get the
 * other. This *does* things to a relation, several in a row, and asks where it
 * ends up — so a relation stops being a fact about two entities and becomes a
 * value being carried through a computation. That is the step from reasoning about
 * a structure to reasoning about operations on structures, and nothing else in
 * this app asks for it.
 *
 * ── Order matters, and it is checked that it does ──
 *
 * A quarter turn and a mirror do not commute. That is the whole reason the
 * contexts are a *sequence* rather than a set, so an item where the order did not
 * matter would be teaching the opposite of the lesson. Every item is checked by
 * swapping two adjacent operations and confirming the answer changes — on the
 * shipped card, not in the construction.
 *
 * ── Doubling is left out, and why ──
 *
 * Isomorph also doubles a context. The answer here is a direction on each axis,
 * and doubling changes no direction — so a card that doubled would state an
 * operation the answer could not reflect, which is worse than not offering it.
 * Asking for magnitudes instead would need every premise to state distances, which
 * is a different mode. Everything kept changes the directions: reversal, a mirror
 * along one axis, a quarter turn, and counting only where another context moves.
