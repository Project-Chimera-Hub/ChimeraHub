/**
 * Minimal Premises — which of these were actually needed.
 *
 * Isomorph's guide: *"The premises settle how two entities stand, and most of
 * them are not needed for it. Select the smallest set of premises that on its
 * own still settles the pair in every direction — one route per direction,
 * sharing premises where it can. There is exactly one smallest set."*
 *
 * Every other mode in this app asks what the premises settle. This asks which
 * of them did the settling, which is a different question about the same
 * material and a harder one: a premise that is consistent with the answer is
 * not thereby part of the reason for it, and telling those apart means working
 * out what would still follow without each one.
 *
 * ── Why the floor is honest here ──
 *
 * The other two Incompleteness modes say "exactly one", which makes a guess one
 * in `n` rather than one in `2^n` — the answer space a reader can actually
 * search is the premises, not the subsets of them. This one says "the smallest
 * set", and a set is what the player picks: knowing it is minimal does not
 * narrow which subset it is, so `guessRateFor("select", …)` prices it right
 * without help.
 *
 * ── What makes an item well-formed ──
 *
 * The full premise set settles the pair, or there is nothing to pare down. The
 * smallest sufficient subset is unique — found by trying every subset from the
 * smallest up, which is what makes "there is exactly one smallest set" a
 * checked claim rather than a hope — and it is strictly smaller than the whole,
 * or the item asks the player to select everything.
