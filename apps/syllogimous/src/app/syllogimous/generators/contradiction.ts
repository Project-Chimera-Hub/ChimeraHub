/**
 * Contradiction — the premises cannot all be true, and exactly one is wrong.
 *
 * Isomorph's guide: *"The premises cannot all be true: exactly one is wrong.
 * Find the premise that is on every conflict — withdraw it and the rest agree;
 * withdraw any other and a clash remains."*
 *
 * The rest of the app hands the player a consistent world and asks what follows
 * in it. This hands them one that has no arrangement at all and asks where it
 * broke, which is a different skill and the one that transfers: a real argument
 * that has gone wrong does not announce it, and finding the step that did it
 * means holding the whole thing at once rather than reading forward.
 *
 * ── Why the menu is the premise list ──
 *
 * Every other choice mode here offers two options, because a longer menu can be
 * shortened by looking — three of four claims are about the wrong pair and go
 * without being reasoned about. That argument inverts here, in the same way it
 * does for selections.
 *
 * The options *are* the premises: every one is a sentence of the same shape,
 * about the same entities, under the same invented relation, and none of them
 * carries a surface feature the others lack. Nothing can be dismissed at a
 * glance because there is nothing to glance at — a candidate is ruled out by
 * withdrawing it and finding the rest still clash, which is the work the mode
 * is for. Shortening the menu would not make the item harder either; it would
 * do the finding *for* the player, which is the whole task.
 *
 * `guessRateFor("choice", 0, n)` is exactly `1/n`, so the weaker floor a long
 * menu does carry is already priced. `tests/registries.test.ts` allows the menu
 * on the condition that makes the argument hold — the options are the premises,
 * verbatim — rather than by naming the mode.
 *
 * ── What makes an item well-formed ──
 *
 * Built from a real arrangement and then broken on purpose: one drawn fact is
 * flipped, and the item is kept only if all three of the claims on the card are
 * true of what came out. No arrangement fits the whole set; withdrawing the
 * flipped premise leaves one that does; withdrawing any *other* single premise
 * leaves none. That last check is what "exactly one is wrong" means, and it is
 * checked rather than assumed — a flip can easily leave a second premise that
 * would have done just as well, and the card would then be telling the player
 * something false.
