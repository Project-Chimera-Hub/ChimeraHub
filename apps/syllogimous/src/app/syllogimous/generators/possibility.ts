/**
 * Possibility Sets — select everything that could still be true.
 *
 * The first mode in this app answered by a selection, and the first built over
 * the relation systems rather than over a layout of its own. Both of those are
 * the point: it is the shape the rest of the imported band is made in.
 *
 * Every other mode here builds one arrangement and asks about it, so the only
 * honest answers are "yes", "no" and "one of these". This builds the *set* of
 * arrangements the premises still allow, and asks which outcomes survive in it.
 * A pair every survivor agrees about is settled; a pair they differ on is
 * genuinely open — and "it could be either" stops being a way of not answering
 * and becomes the answer, which is the thing the band exists to train.
 *
 * ── Why only the relations that run one way ──
 *
 * Three outcomes are offered: the relation runs one way, the other way, or
 * neither. On a symmetric system — sameness of group, adjacency, opposition —
 * the first two are the same statement said twice, so one option could never be
 * selected and the reader would learn to ignore it rather than settle it. The
 * systems used here are the ones where all three are distinguishable, which is
 * also what Isomorph's own wording assumes: beats, is beaten by, or neither.
 *
 * ── What makes an item well-formed ──
 *
 * The premises are drawn from a real arrangement, so at least one survives and
 * the answer is never empty by accident. The pair asked about is never one the
 * premises state, or the surviving set would be answering a question it had
 * been handed. And the answer is checked by enumeration rather than by rule:
 * an outcome is offered as possible exactly when some surviving arrangement
 * realises it, which is a fact about the premise set rather than a claim about
 * how it was built.
