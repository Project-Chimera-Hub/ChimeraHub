/**
 * Pivot Transforms — the arrangement moves while it is being described.
 *
 * Isomorph's guide: *"After some premises, everything is mirrored through one
 * entity, or everything turns a quarter turn about it; later premises describe the
 * new positions. State where two entities stand at the end. The early premises are
 * no longer true: carry them through the move."*
 *
 * This app already has a Transformation mode, and it is not this one. There, each
 * transformation moves *one* object relative to an anchor and every other premise
 * stays true. Here the move takes the whole space with it, and the premises that
 * came before it stop describing anything — they described where things were. A
 * reader who keeps reading them as current facts will get a consistent, wrong
 * answer, which is the failure worth provoking: it is what happens to anybody
 * reasoning from a model they have not updated.
 *
 * ── Two moves, not three ──
 *
 * Isomorph also has everyone but the pivot taking the next one's place along a
 * line. That needs the entities to *be* in a line, which a layout in three
 * directions does not give you, and faking one would make the premises describe a
 * different space from the one being reasoned about. Mirroring through an entity
 * and turning a quarter about it both work on any axis stack, so those are the two.
 *
 * ── What makes an item well-formed ──
 *
 * The answer is required to *differ* from what it would be if the move were
 * ignored. That is the whole item: a move a reader could skip and still get right
 * is a move that trains nothing, and it is the easy accident here — a mirror
 * through a pivot leaves anything collinear with it looking much as it did. The
 * check is on the shipped answer, not on the construction.
