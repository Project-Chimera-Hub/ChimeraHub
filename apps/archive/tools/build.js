/*
 * Build the archive from everything on this machine.
 *
 *     node tools/build.js
 *
 * Finds the Anki collections, the trainer exports in ~/Downloads and any archive
 * you already have, folds the lot together and writes one file.
 *
 * WHY THIS USES THE PAGE'S OWN MODULES
 * ------------------------------------
 * The merge is the whole promise of the project, and it is tested. A second
 * implementation of it here — in Python, or hand-rolled — would be a second
 * source of truth about what "already imported" means, and the two would drift
 * in the direction nobody notices: quietly counting something twice. So this
 * requires `js/record.js` and `js/archive.js` and does no merging of its own.
 *
 * WHERE THE ARCHIVE GOES
 * ----------------------
 * **Outside the repository**, in your home directory. This repo can be pushed to
 * GitHub; your training record should not be. `.gitignore` covers the filenames
 * too, in case one is ever written here by hand.
