"""Read an Anki collection's review log into a training-archive source file.

    python3 tools/anki-export.py                       # finds your collection
    python3 tools/anki-export.py --out anki.json       # somewhere specific
    python3 tools/anki-export.py --collection path/to/collection.anki2

Then drop the JSON on the archive page.

WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT AN ADAPTER IN THE PAGE
---------------------------------------------------
An Anki collection is a SQLite database. Reading one in a browser means shipping
a WebAssembly build of SQLite, and a `.colpkg` means a zip reader and, on recent
versions, a zstd decoder as well. That is a toolchain, and the archive's one
structural promise is that it still runs in five years without one.

Python 3 has `sqlite3` in its standard library. So the reading happens here, with
no dependencies at all, and the page stays a thing that reads JSON.

This is also the pattern for every other source you did not write: a small script
that emits `{"schema": "training-archive-source/1", ...}`. The page takes that
shape as it stands, so a new source never needs the page to change.

WHAT IT READS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
-------------------------------------------------
Only `revlog` — one row per review, carrying when, how long, and how it went —
plus deck *names*, so a review can say which subject it belonged to.

It never reads `notes`. None of your card content, questions, answers or media
goes into the archive, which matters because an archive is a file you might hand
to someone, and because none of it would tell you anything about your training
anyway.

The collection is copied before it is opened. Anki holds a lock on the live file
and a reader can corrupt a collection that is being written to; a copy cannot.
